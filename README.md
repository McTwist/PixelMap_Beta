PixelMap is a mapper for Minecraft. Currently this is version 0.85 that supports up to Beta 1.5.

There is a newer source available, but sadly it wasn't possible to add it as too much changes was added but never finished. It is currently not possible to determine if this ever will be fixed in the future.

Feel free to play around with the first C++ project that I released. Excuse the mess.
